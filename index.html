          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel i
          got evry penny's worth.

            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up the free intro course and found
            it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
            was the best-and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course. I've successfully switched careers. working as a
            software Engineer at a VR startup.</q

            >Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. i was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of their's who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. The
            were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during interviews as an
            example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a
            job as a fullstack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend!

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

            really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
            be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest.You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
            and amazing people.
